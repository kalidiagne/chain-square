# Chain Square
Chain Square is an engaging social network platform designed to bring recognition and rewards to the very core of on-chain activity: the users. 
By highlighting and incentivizing on-chain actions, we're not only contributing to the dynamic ecosystem but also creating an exciting on-chain engagement using NFT.

With Chain Square, we're changing the narrative by acknowledging that every on-chain action, no matter how big or small, holds significant value. We empower users by rewarding the most active on-chain participants. But it's not just about who makes the most transactions; it's about creating a more interactive, participative, and rewarding blockchain experience.

Unlock a new dimension of blockchain engagement with Chain Square, where every transaction counts, every interaction matters, and every participant wins. Join us in this exciting journey and let your on-chain activity be your ticket to a more rewarding blockchain experience.

### Supported on-chain activity (v1.0)
- **Chain Interaction**: The ranking of users is based on the number of unique networks they've interacted with, prioritizing those who engaged with them the earliest.
- **Transactions**: The quantity of transactions a user has executed on the testnet (Goerli).
- **Newest address**: The most recent address that has carried out an actual transaction.
